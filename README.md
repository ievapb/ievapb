👋 Hi, I’m Ieva Bareikė

👀 I’m interested in finding remote job as either:
-    business process manager (10+ years in project and process management) or
-    software developer (for entry/junior position)
       
       
🌱 I'm working towards my stack: Python, Django, PostgreSQL

🛠️ My tools VSCode, PowerShell, Jira
 
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that would help me hone my skills, get industry know-how from peers and build my portfolio
