👋 Hi, I’m Ieva Bareikė

👀 I’m interested in changing career to tech and looking for remote job as either:
-    IT projects manager (10+ years in non-IT project management) or
-    software developer (for entry/junior position)       
       
🌱 I'm working towards my stack: Python, Django, PostgreSQL

🛠️ My tools VSCode, PowerShell, Jira
 
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that would help me hone my skills, get industry know-how from peers and build my portfolio
 
📫 How to reach me: ieva.bareike@gmail.com
